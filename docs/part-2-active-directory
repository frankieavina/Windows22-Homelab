# Part 2 – Active Directory Domain Services Deployment

## Introduction
This part of the project focuses on deploying Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) on the Windows Server 2022 virtual machine created in Part 1. Active Directory is a core component of Windows-based enterprise environments and provides centralized authentication, authorization, and identity management.

In this phase, the server is promoted to a Domain Controller by creating a new forest and domain. This establishes the foundation for user management, group policies, DNS integration, and domain-joined client systems in later parts of the project.

## Objectives
The objectives of this phase are:
- Install the Active Directory Domain Services role
- Promote the server to a Domain Controller
- Create a new Active Directory forest and domain
- Verify successful deployment and functionality

---

## Installing Active Directory Domain Services
The Active Directory Domain Services role was installed using Server Manager.

### Installation Steps
1. Opened **Server Manager**
2. Selected **Add Roles and Features**
3. Chose **Role-based or feature-based installation**
4. Selected the local server
5. Installed **Active Directory Domain Services**
6. Allowed required features to be added automatically
7. Completed role installation

At this stage, the server was prepared for promotion to a Domain Controller.

## Domain and Forest Configuration
After installing the AD DS role, the server was promoted to a Domain Controller.

### Domain Configuration Details
- Deployment Type: New forest
- Domain Name: `homelab.local`
- Domain Functional Level: Windows Server 2022
- Forest Functional Level: Windows Server 2022

A Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password was configured to allow offline maintenance and recovery scenarios.

## omain Controller Promotion
The Active Directory configuration wizard was used to complete the promotion process.

### Promotion Steps
- Enabled DNS Server role installation
- Verified NetBIOS name assignment
- Accepted default database, log, and SYSVOL paths
- Completed prerequisite checks
- Initiated Domain Controller promotion

The system automatically rebooted upon completion.

---

## Post-Deployment Verification
After reboot, multiple validation steps were performed to confirm successful deployment.

### Verification Tasks
- Logged in using domain administrator credentials
- Verified **Active Directory Users and Computers** console access
- Confirmed **DNS Manager** presence and functionality
- Checked **Server Manager** for AD DS status
- Reviewed **Event Viewer** logs for errors or warnings

All core services were confirmed to be running normally.

---

## Results and Observations
The deployment successfully resulted in:
- A functioning Active Directory forest
- A stable Domain Controller
- Integrated DNS services
- A ready environment for user, group, and policy management

Performance was stable, and no critical errors were observed during validation.
