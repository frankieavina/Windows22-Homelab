# Windows 22 Homelab on Unraid Server

## Overview
This project documents the deployment of a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine running Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) within an Unraid-based homelab environment.

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with:
- Windows Server administration
- Active Directory fundamentals
- Virtualization using Unraid
- Identity, authentication, and domain management concepts

This repository is structured as a technical paper and lab documentation suitable for professional review.

## Lab Objectives
- Deploy Windows Server 2022 as a VM on Unraid
- Promote the server to a Domain Controller
- Configure Active Directory Domain Services
- Create and manage users, groups, and organizational units
- Lay groundwork for future Group Policy and DNS configuration

## Environment
